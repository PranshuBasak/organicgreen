## Tech Stack/Libraries Used

1. **Vite:** A build tool for modern web projects, offering fast development and optimized builds.
2. **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
3. **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.


## Steps to Run/Build the Project

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PranshuBasak/organicgreen.git
    cd organicgreen
    ```
    
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
    
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    

### Starting the Development Server

1. To start the app in development mode, run:
    
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    
2. Open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) in your browser to view the app. The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code. Lint errors, if any, will be displayed in the console.
    

### Building for Production

1. To build the app for production, use:
    
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    
2. This command will bundle React in production mode and optimize the build for the best performance. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist` folder (as Vite defaults to `dist` rather than `build`), with filenames containing hashes. Your app will be ready for deployment.
